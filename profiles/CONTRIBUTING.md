Policy on Local Profile Submission for DCI Standards

To ensure consistency, transparency, and quality, all local profiles within the DCI Standards must be submitted, reviewed, and approved according to the following workflow.

1. Submission

    Profiles (schemas and associated metadata) must be submitted as a GitHub Pull Request (PR) to the DCI standards repository.

    Submissions must follow the prescribed schema guidelines, metadata format, and naming conventions.

    Each PR must include:

    The schema definition.

    Metadata description (version, authorship, and intended use case).

    A changelog entry (for updates).

2. Repository Management Team Review

    Responsibilities:

    Triage new PRs for completeness and adherence to contribution guidelines.

    Check formatting, metadata, and file placement.

    Assign PRs to the standards development team for technical review.

    Ensure process transparency by tagging and labeling PRs appropriately.

3. Standards Development Team Review

    Responsibilities:

    Conduct a technical evaluation of the submitted profile, verifying:

    Alignment with DCI interoperability principles.

    Consistency with existing profiles.

    Backward compatibility, where relevant.

    Request changes and provide technical feedback directly on the PR.

    Approve or reject submissions based on technical merit and compliance.


4. Approval & Registry Update

    Once approved by the standards development team, the profile will be:

    Marked as approved in registry-index.yaml.

    Merged into the main branch of the repository.

    The profile then becomes an official DCI-compliant profile.
